# Local cobalt instance lifecycle for the stash download engine toggle.
# cobalt ships only as a Docker image (no Arch package, no public API), so the
# "Cobalt engine" switch in the stash Tools section drives a single container
# named ryoku-cobalt, bound to loopback. Kept between runs so on/off is instant
# after the first pull.
#
# tab-separated, line-buffered status the shell (Stash.qml) parses:
#   status -> "docker\t<missing|denied|ready>" then "cobalt\t<absent|stopped|running>"
#   up     -> "STATUS\t<pulling|starting>" ... then "READY" or "ERROR\t<message>"
#   down   -> "STATUS\tstopping" then "STOPPED" or "ERROR\t<message>"
# usage: stash-cobalt-server.sh status | up | down
